She would love to live in a world where socks always have their matches, mini-golf games are televised, and hot cocoa is always served with giant, fluffy homemade butterscotch flavored marshmallows. She parked thousands of cars on the Penobscot River shores when she helped create Bangor\\u2019s Car Show: Wheels on the Waterfront and introduced new brews to the masses with Bangor\\u2019s Beer Festival \\u2013 Tap into Summer. All was done while she was the director of marketing and promotions for the Greater Bangor Convention & Visitors Bureau in Maine. Skilled at no and low-cost marketing, she\\u2019s always looking for new and innovative ways to promote products, which helped her as an account supervisor for Marshall Communications. There she oversaw the web development department and several clients\\u2019 portfolios, including PR for Orvis and Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce. You can find her most days striving to end hunger, writing PR and strategic marketing plans, navigating social platforms\\u2019 algorithms, and working from home with her 70-pound Great Pyr mix named Bumble and new addition, Higgins, a lab mix puppy. And, yes, Bumbles do bounce!\"\n",
