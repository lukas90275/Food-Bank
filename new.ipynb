Nadeau nurtures a high-engagement culture throughout the Food Bank’s statewide workforce that supports talent development, fosters employee wellbeing, and positions the organization to meet its short- and long-term goals. Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner. She raises her three children to lead with kindness, compassion, and awareness.\n",

In this role, she responded to the strategic priority of centering the voices of those most impacted by hunger in the Food Bank’s work and decision-making. In 2019, alongside many community partners, Meg supported the Building Advocates Leadership Program (BALP) launch, a program designed to center and uplift the voices of food-insecure Mainers in a statewide movement to end hunger. In 2021, the evolving work and priorities of the Food Bank culminated in a deepening commitment to understanding the racial and economic disparities underlying hunger. Meg accepted the director of equity, diversity, and inclusion position, now the vice president of equity and impact. She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine. Outside of her work with Good Shepherd Food Bank, Meg co-founded Twin Villages Foodbank Farm alongside her partner, Sara, and their daughter, Adley. Meg previously owned and operated Seed by Seed Farm and supported the start-up of an immigrant growers’ cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin. She has an M.Ed in Diversity and Social Justice from the University of Massachusetts, focusing on food access and security.\n",

      "     Nicole Nadeau, vice president of people and culture, joined Good Shepherd Food Bank in February 2010. Nadeau nurtures a high-engagement culture throughout the Food Bank’s statewide workforce that supports talent development, fosters employee wellbeing, and positions the organization to meet its short- and long-term goals. Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner. She raises her three children to lead with kindness, compassion, and awareness.\n",

In this role, she responded to the strategic priority of centering the voices of those most impacted by hunger in the Food Bank’s work and decision-making. In 2019, alongside many community partners, Meg supported the Building Advocates Leadership Program (BALP) launch, a program designed to center and uplift the voices of food-insecure Mainers in a statewide movement to end hunger. In 2021, the evolving work and priorities of the Food Bank culminated in a deepening commitment to understanding the racial and economic disparities underlying hunger. Meg accepted the director of equity, diversity, and inclusion position, now the vice president of equity and impact. She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine. Outside of her work with Good Shepherd Food Bank, Meg co-founded Twin Villages Foodbank Farm alongside her partner, Sara, and their daughter, Adley. Meg previously owned and operated Seed by Seed Farm and supported the start-up of an immigrant growers’ cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin. She has an M.Ed in Diversity and Social Justice from the University of Massachusetts, focusing on food access and security.\n",

      "     Nicole Nadeau, vice president of people and culture, joined Good Shepherd Food Bank in February 2010. Nadeau nurtures a high-engagement culture throughout the Food Bank’s statewide workforce that supports talent development, fosters employee wellbeing, and positions the organization to meet its short- and long-term goals. Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner. She raises her three children to lead with kindness, compassion, and awareness.\n",

In this role, she responded to the strategic priority of centering the voices of those most impacted by hunger in the Food Bank’s work and decision-making. In 2019, alongside many community partners, Meg supported the Building Advocates Leadership Program (BALP) launch, a program designed to center and uplift the voices of food-insecure Mainers in a statewide movement to end hunger. In 2021, the evolving work and priorities of the Food Bank culminated in a deepening commitment to understanding the racial and economic disparities underlying hunger. Meg accepted the director of equity, diversity, and inclusion position, now the vice president of equity and impact. She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine. Outside of her work with Good Shepherd Food Bank, Meg co-founded Twin Villages Foodbank Farm alongside her partner, Sara, and their daughter, Adley. Meg previously owned and operated Seed by Seed Farm and supported the start-up of an immigrant growers’ cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin. She has an M.Ed in Diversity and Social Justice from the University of Massachusetts, focusing on food access and security.\n",

      "     Nicole Nadeau, vice president of people and culture, joined Good Shepherd Food Bank in February 2010. Nadeau nurtures a high-engagement culture throughout the Food Bank’s statewide workforce that supports talent development, fosters employee wellbeing, and positions the organization to meet its short- and long-term goals. Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner. She raises her three children to lead with kindness, compassion, and awareness.\n",

In this role, she responded to the strategic priority of centering the voices of those most impacted by hunger in the Food Bank’s work and decision-making. In 2019, alongside many community partners, Meg supported the Building Advocates Leadership Program (BALP) launch, a program designed to center and uplift the voices of food-insecure Mainers in a statewide movement to end hunger. In 2021, the evolving work and priorities of the Food Bank culminated in a deepening commitment to understanding the racial and economic disparities underlying hunger. Meg accepted the director of equity, diversity, and inclusion position, now the vice president of equity and impact. She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine. Outside of her work with Good Shepherd Food Bank, Meg co-founded Twin Villages Foodbank Farm alongside her partner, Sara, and their daughter, Adley. Meg previously owned and operated Seed by Seed Farm and supported the start-up of an immigrant growers’ cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin.

Nadeau nurtures a high-engagement culture throughout the Food Bank’s statewide workforce that supports talent development, fosters employee wellbeing, and positions the organization to meet its short- and long-term goals. Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner. She raises her three children to lead with kindness, compassion, and awareness.\n",

She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine.

Nadeau nurtures a high-engagement culture throughout the Food Bank’s statewide workforce that supports talent development, fosters employee wellbeing, and positions the organization to meet its short- and long-term goals. Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner. She raises her three children to lead with kindness, compassion, and awareness.\n",

Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community. She offers mentorship and group support sessions at the women’s facility in Windham, Maine. She is an avid reader, explorer, and learner.

      "     Meg Taft joined Good Shepherd Food Bank in 2018 as the advocacy and community organizing manager. In this role, she responded to the strategic priority of centering the voices of those most impacted by hunger in the Food Bank’s work and decision-making. In 2019, alongside many community partners, Meg supported the Building Advocates Leadership Program (BALP) launch, a program designed to center and uplift the voices of food-insecure Mainers in a statewide movement to end hunger. In 2021, the evolving work and priorities of the Food Bank culminated in a deepening commitment to understanding the racial and economic disparities underlying hunger. Meg accepted the director of equity, diversity, and inclusion position, now the vice president of equity and impact. She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine. Outside of her work with Good Shepherd Food Bank, Meg co-founded Twin Villages Foodbank Farm alongside her partner, Sara, and their daughter, Adley. Meg previously owned and operated Seed by Seed Farm and supported the start-up of an immigrant growers’ cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin. She has an M.Ed in Diversity and Social Justice from the University of Massachusetts, focusing on food access and security.\n",

Her work is grounded in building meaningful relationships and delivering a great employee and volunteer experience. She is fascinated by learning about the energy and joy within everyone. General Mills previously employed Nadeau in Scottsdale, Arizona. While at General Mills, she was approached by St. Mary’s Food Bank to host a volunteer group and donate cereal to the food bank. On her first experience with any food bank, she was captivated by the work the Food Bank was doing and fell in love with the spirit and essence of community support and helping others. Five years later, Nadeau moved to Maine and was excited to see an opportunity as a gift processor at Good Shepherd Food Bank. After a year in the gift processing role, she moved into the Human Resources department. Nadeau is a volunteer working with incarcerated women in recovery as they prepare to return to their community.

      "     Meg Taft joined Good Shepherd Food Bank in 2018 as the advocacy and community organizing manager. In this role, she responded to the strategic priority of centering the voices of those most impacted by hunger in the Food Bank’s work and decision-making. In 2019, alongside many community partners, Meg supported the Building Advocates Leadership Program (BALP) launch, a program designed to center and uplift the voices of food-insecure Mainers in a statewide movement to end hunger. In 2021, the evolving work and priorities of the Food Bank culminated in a deepening commitment to understanding the racial and economic disparities underlying hunger. Meg accepted the director of equity, diversity, and inclusion position, now the vice president of equity and impact. She has a deep background and professional experience leading equity and diversity work. In this role, Meg works closely with the Equity and Impact Team and her colleagues across the Food Bank to envision a more just and equitable food system in Maine. Outside of her work with Good Shepherd Food Bank, Meg co-founded Twin Villages Foodbank Farm alongside her partner, Sara, and their daughter, Adley. Meg previously owned and operated Seed by Seed Farm and supported the start-up of an immigrant growers’ cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin. She has an M.Ed in Diversity and Social Justice from the University of Massachusetts, focusing on food access and security.\n",
